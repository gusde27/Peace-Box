Coding capabilities appear only at night, am I correct or am I correct? The problem is, that habit went on for too long and it evolved into insomnia. I was battling with insomnia for awhile until I found the Box Breathing Technique on social media, I did a mini research and found that it can help us relax, reduce stress, and help us to sleep, etc. I tried to practice this method every night and it worked. I slowly started to be able to control my emotion, reduce my stress, and I could finally sleep. Insomnia hasn't been an issue since then."

Peace Box's main feature is to help people to do the box breathing technique which includes animation, countdown time, and instructions. the animation is a Gif which is used as an example of box breathing simulation, countdown is used to determine the time of box breathing, and instructions to find out what we should do. There are also additional features such as pause  if we want to stop for a moment and a reset feature when it goes wrong and we want to repeat the box breathing."
